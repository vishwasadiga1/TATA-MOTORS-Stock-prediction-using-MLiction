# TATA-MOTORS-Stock-prediction-using-MLiction
To predict the stock prices of TATA MOTORS with machine learning, I will be using the Regression Algorithms as it is one of the best approaches. So here, I will start by importing the necessary Python libraries and collecting the latest stock price data of Tata Motors.
I have downloaded the necessary data i.e, stocks data file from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TATAMOTORS.NS/history in the form of CSV file.
Also whlie importing the data in your code, make sure to change read_csv(for CSV file format) to read_xlsv(for excel file format) if you have downloaded the date from other sources.
Have a great day !
